Cool.  Now let's do biathlon.  This will go in /Users/syverjohansen/ski/elo/python/biathlon/polars and excel365 will have races.csv.  Take a look at the races.csv.  Date	Startlist	Sex	City	Country	Distance	RaceType	Period	Elevation	Championship these are the columns.  

Since biathlon is not FIS we need to scrape it in a different way and that is through firstskisport.com.  Don’t worry about the Startlist URLs I will fill those in manually through biathlonworld.com.  This is the link to the men’s Calendar https://firstskisport.com/biathlon/calendar.php?y=2026 and this is for ladies https://firstskisport.com/biathlon/calendar.php?y=2026&g=w.

You can see date here at 2025-11-30… should be reformated to MM/DD/YYYY

2) Startlist: As I said I’ll fill it out later.

3) Sex.  Should be gathered from the URL

4) City. Would be Östersund

5) Country: SWE → Sweden

6) Distance: Should follow logic from RaceType (7).  If RaceType is Relay or Single Mixed Relay or Mixed Relay , then distance is N/A.  If it is Sprint it is 10 for men, 7.5 for ladies.  Individual is 20 for men, 15 for ladies.  Mass Start is 15 for men, 12.5 for ladies.  Pursuit is 12.5 for men and 10 for ladies.

7) RaceType.  The RaceTypes are Sprint, Mass Start, Individual, Pursuit, Relay, Single Mixed Relay, and Mixed Relay.  Sprint will map to Sprint, Mass Start will map to Mass Start, Individual will map to Individual, Pursuit will map to Pursuit, Relay will map to Relay, Single Mixed will map to Single Mixed Relay, and Mixed will map to Mixed Relay.

8) Period.  This would be the same as the other ones where 1-3 are equal in length, 4 is the Olympics and 5 is after the Olympics.

9) Elevation.  Also taken from elevation.csv

10) Championship.  </tr><tr>
			<td style="display:none;">2026-02-08 00:00:00</td>
			<td>08.02</td>
			<td align="center">OWG</td>
			<td><img src="../img/flag/ITA.png" class="flag" title="ITA" align="center" /> Antholz-Anterselva</td>
			<td>Mixed</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr><tr>
			<td style="display:none;">2026-02-10 00:00:00</td>
			<td>10.02</td>
			<td align="center">OWG</td>
			<td><img src="../img/flag/ITA.png" class="flag" title="ITA" align="center" /> Antholz-Anterselva</td>
			<td>Individual</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>

See that it says OWG?  That means Olympics and should be 1 for championship.
